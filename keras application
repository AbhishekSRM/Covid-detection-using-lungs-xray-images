Keras Applications
Build Status

Keras Applications is the applications module of
the Keras deep learning library.
It provides model definitions and pre-trained weights for a number
of popular archictures, such as VGG16, ResNet50, Xception, MobileNet, and more.

Read the documentation at: https://keras.io/applications/

Keras Applications may be imported directly
from an up-to-date installation of Keras:

from keras import applications
Keras Applications is compatible with Python 2.7-3.6
and is distributed under the MIT license.

Performance
The top-k accuracies were obtained using Keras Applications with the TensorFlow backend on the 2012 ILSVRC ImageNet validation set and may slightly differ from the original ones.
Input: input size fed into models
Top-1: single center crop, top-1 accuracy
Top-5: single center crop, top-5 accuracy
Size: rounded the number of parameters when include_top=True
Stem: rounded the number of parameters when include_top=False
